# Walk Around

AFRAME example using a nav-mesh to restrict regions where we can walk.

1. Use the [Navigation Mesh A-Frame Inspector Plugin](https://github.com/donmccurdy/aframe-inspector-plugin-recast) to create a [nav-mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh).
2. Export the mesh as GLTF file.
3. Use it in your A-Frame code as demonstrated here.
